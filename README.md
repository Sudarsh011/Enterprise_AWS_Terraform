# Enterprise_AWS_Terraform

Important considerations:

Security: Use encryption (in transit and at rest), VPCs, private subnets, IAM policies, and security groups.
Compliance: Ensure the infrastructure complies with financial regulations such as SOC2, PCI DSS, etc.
Scalability & Reliability: Leverage auto-scaling, multi-AZ (Availability Zones) setups, load balancing, and monitoring.
Monitoring: Use AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.


Key Components of the Template:
VPC with Subnets:
Public and private subnets are created in three availability zones for high availability.
Security Groups:
Security groups control traffic access (SSH and HTTP in this example).
EC2 Instance:
An EC2 instance in the public subnet with SSH access. It also has an attached IAM role to access S3 and CloudWatch.
RDS (PostgreSQL):
A multi-AZ RDS instance with encryption and backup.
S3 Bucket:
An encrypted S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
CloudWatch Logging:
CloudWatch log group for application logs.
IAM Role:
An IAM role to provide EC2 access to S3 and CloudWatch logs.
Auto Scaling and Load Balancing (Optional):
Auto Scaling group and Load Balancer for high availability and fault tolerance.
Additional Considerations for Enterprise Use:
Encryption: Use KMS to encrypt sensitive data (like databases and S3).
Security: Make sure to fine-tune IAM policies, avoid open ports for SSH in production, and secure access using VPN or Direct Connect.
Compliance: Ensure logging, auditing, and encryption meet banking compliance standards.
Disaster Recovery: Implement backup and multi-region replication if needed.
